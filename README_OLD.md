   #### Note:

- **Here is a [DEMO VERSION](https://t.me/coolshot_ai_v2_bot) of this bot project. You can test it out for 🆓**

- 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐭 𝐀𝐈 𝐕2 Telegram bot project is designed to automate tasks, respond to commands, and integrate with external services or APIs, offering users a robust interactive experience.

## Features

- **Respond to Specific Commands**: The bot listens and responds to user-defined commands.

- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for easy user interaction.

## Deployment and Setup

### Necessities

- Telegram account
- Telegram Bot Token
- Telegram Bot User ID(uid)
- **[`HERE IS`](https://github.com/RayBen445/Cool-Shot-AI-V2/blob/main/gift/bot-token-and-uid.md) How to get your BOT TOKEN and BOT UID**

- **First [Fork Repo](https://github.com/RayBen445/Cool-Shot-AI-V2/fork) to obtain your editable repo.**

### Configure the Bot:
   - Ensure you **[Fork Repo](https://github.com/RayBen445/Cool-Shot-AI-V2/fork)** first.

   - There's a set.js.
   - Navigate to it and Add your bot token, bot user ID(id) and other settings:
     ```
     "ownerId": bot owner user id
     ```
     ```
     "botToken": "bot token "
     ```

### Deployment

- **Deploy on [HEROKU](https://github.com/RayBen445/Cool-Shot-AI-V2/blob/main/gift/heroku.md)**

- **Deploy on [RENDER](https://dashboard.render.com/new)**
  
  - Follow other specific platform instructions to deploy your bot because as for me I do use Heroku.

## Usage

To interact with the bot, users can send commands and messages. The bot will respond based on its features and functionality. Here are some examples:

- `/menu / /start` - Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `And Many Other Cmds` - Use the bot to discover by yourself.
